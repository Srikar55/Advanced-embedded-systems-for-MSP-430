# Advanced-embedded-systems-for-MSP-430
The objective of this project is to learn the working of MSP430G2553 IC, use various components like 
LED, accelerometer, potentiometer and uart communication between two ICs. In order to achieve this, we have 
slowly build on using each component at a time until getting the final project. In the Project, an ultrasonic 
sensor is connected to chip 1. It is used to find the distance in cm and display it on Quad-Digit 7 segment LED connected to chip
2 using UART communication. An accelerometer I also is connected, and it displays the x and y axis is a
0â€“90-degree range on the Quad-Digit 7 segment LED using UART connections. Two buttons are present.
One to switch between ultrasonic sensor and accelerometer and the other one is used to select a
distance. A buzzer is used to buzz when the distance selected by the user is displayed or if the
accelerometer is placed on a flat surface or when the x and y-axis read 0 on the Quad-Digit 7 segment
LED. All these components were soldered on a perforated board to build a embedded system which runs
on a battery.
