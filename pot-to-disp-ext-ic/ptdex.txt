This code is an example of an embedded system program written in C for the MSP430 microcontroller. It demonstrates the use of the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) to read the value of a potentiometer and display the corresponding digits on a 7-segment LED display. The program includes functions to set up the necessary ports and pins, configure the ADC, correct oscillations in the ADC readings, and control the display of the digits. It uses a series of if-else statements to handle different ranges of ADC values and turn on the corresponding segments of the LED display. The program also includes delay functions to control the timing of the display updates.
It displays ADC value of a potentiometer on a quad digit 7-segment LED using an off-board IC msp430g2452. The potentiometer and the quad digit 7-segment LED were connected to msp430g2452 that was placed on a breadboard. Then uploaded the code to msp430g2452 using TI board. The chip was capable of displaying ADC from the potentiometer to the quad digit 7-segment LED only with Vcc and gnd from the TI board.
